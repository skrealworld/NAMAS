(this could explain the origin of volcano-likefeatures on europa.)once exposed to the near vacuum that exists at the moon's surface, the brinywater would quickly evaporate, leaving the salts behind.as yet, there is no evidence that europa has hydrothermal vents on its oceanfloor.``but if there is an ocean, there has to be heat coming out of the mantle,''mccord says, ``so there almost have to be hydrothermal vents.''there is certainly no reason that hydrothermal vents couldn't exist in oceanson worlds other than our own. in fact, the mars global surveyor missionrecently found signs of a large deposit of hematite _ a mineral often formedby hydrothermal activity _ near mars' equator.if the hematite deposit does indeed mark the site of a large ancient body ofhot water, it would be an ideal place to search for past life on mars.a briny europan sea might also contain evidence of past life. but unlike mars,europa may still harbor some kind of life.``it is felt that carbon dioxide in the ocean created a fertile environmentfor the formation of life on earth,'' mccord says.carbonates create a less acidic environment, one more favorable for life.``here we have, perhaps, a carbon dioxide-rich ocean. it's one more thing thatsuggests that the ocean could be a habitat for life.''_______ &qc;&ur; (kathy a. svitil is an associate editor for discover magazine.)&lr; &ql;_______ &qc;(to purchase this special ``one-shot'' feature from discover magazine _ therate is not prohibitive _ contact one of these new york times syndicate salesrepresentatives:(_ u.s. and the pacific: connie white in kansas city at 1-800-444-0267 or816-822-8448, or fax her at 816-822-1444.(_ europe and asia: karl horwitz in paris at 47-42-17-11; fax, 47-42-80-44 or47-42-18-81; telex, 282-942. &lr;(_ latin america: olivia vasquez in los angeles at (310) 996-0075; fax:310-996-0089.nyt-09-25-98 1257edt &ql;
