after a delayed launch on october 18, 1989, the galileo probe arrived atjupiter in december 1995. it made important discoveries about jupiter and itsfour largest moons, io, ganymede, europa and callisto and extended its twoyear mission an additional two years. observations forced revision ofplanetary evolution theories. there are lower than expected levels of helium,neon, carbon, oxygen and sulfur twice the expected argon and nitrogen.there is an intense radiation belt above jupiter's clouds. super lighteningindicates copious water and strong convection driving super storms. dust frommoon impacts caused jupiter's better imaged faint rings. io's volcanoes thehottest in the solar system erased all craters with a red and yellowmineral surface. an iron core half its diameter, strong tidal forces fromjupiter and electric fields energize intense red, blue and green gaseouslights. ganymede is the first moon in the solar system with its own strongmagnetic strong, indicating a molten metal core. heat-producing, reversingelectro-magnetic fields, tidal forces from jupiter and thousand-mile longscalloped ice cracks oozing salt deposits and possible organic compounds,indicate europa may have a salty, carbonated subsurface ocean, possiblyharboring simple life. europa has earth-like surface faults. callisto haselectro-magnetic field interactions with jupiter, but no dense core or tidalforces. it may also have a subsurface ocean. after launch two antennas failedto open. by 1999 galileo's gyros, computers and tape recorder had degraded.galileo briefly entered safe-mode twice in 1999 and once in 2000.
